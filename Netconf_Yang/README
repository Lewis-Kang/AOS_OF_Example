For Ofconfig, we currently use OFconfig 1.1.1.
You can use Ofconfig 1.1.1 to setup controller, but for VxLAN part it need use our augment yang file, ofconfig-aug.yang.
Becaue ofconfig 1.1.1 doesn't consider the encapsulated packet output port, it only provide (SIP, DIP).
And it also doesn't consider the packet classify for VxLAN tunnel or not for VxLAN tunnel.
We adapt the OFDPA design first and use ofconfig-aug.yang to configured.

And there is a big bug (I think) in ofconfig 1.1.1, when create logical port, ofconfig 1.1.1 need to fill all node.
I think it may change in next version. (I ever dicuss this with Netopeer author, he told me he is dicussing with ONF)
